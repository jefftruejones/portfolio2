			<h2>Hey There! I'm Jeff True Jones.</h2>

			<p>I am a Web Developer who lives in Durham, North Carolina.</p>

			<p>Before pursing web development, I worked as a full-time cruise ship musician and entertainer, and as a music teacher.</p>

			<p>The experience I have gained from the entertainment industry inspires me to create web sites and web applications that are:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>creative</li>
				<li>accessible</li>
				<li>scaleable</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>About Jeff True Jones</h2>

			<p>I've enjoyed creative pursuits for as long as I can rememver. I've always been writing poems, stories, and songs, or putting on a play.</p>

			<p>As an adult, the majority of my career has been in the entertainment industry. I've worked on cruise ships, toured the United States, and even was featured on American Idol</p>

			<p>As such, I have needed to learn about maintaining a web presence. I have always designed my own promotional websites utilizing various CMS like Wordpress. It was through that trial and error process that I discovered my love for web development.</p>

			<p>Currently, I am a student with <a href="https://thinful.com">Thinkful</a> pursuing a full-time career in web development.</p>

			<p>Some of my goals include:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>working for a music tech company</li>
				<li>designing musical smartphone apps</li>
			
			</ul>
