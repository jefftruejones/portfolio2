# portfolio2
* Context: *

> * This is my professional porfolio of web development work.

# User: 

> * The intended user is myself and prospective employers, to give them an idea of who I am and the quality of my code.

# Use: 

> * This is intended to be used as my portfolio to send to prospective employers

# Features: 

> * This version of my porfolio is updated from a former version in order to include a section about my current projects

# Technologies used: 

> * I created this portfolio using vanilla HTML and CSS, and my focus was on creating a responsive design using flexbox.

# Discoveries: 

> * This was my first attempt at responsive design and mobile-first development. It's an interesting shift from designing for a big screen first.

# Future goals for this project: 

> * I intend to redesign it and utilize a CSS framework, perhaps Pure.css or Bulma, in order to make it appear more professional,
and include live versions of the applications I've developed.

# Screenshots/Images: 

> * coming soon.
